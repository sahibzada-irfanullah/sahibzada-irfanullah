      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Irfan Ullah is a Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science from Kyung Hee University, South Korea. He received his Masters in Computer Science from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan, and has held research and teaching positions at NUST and the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science, and Technology (FUUAST), as well as a development role at the multinational Knowledge Platform in Pakistan. He is also a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Kyung Hee University.

With a strong academic background and a record of winning multiple awards for excellent performance, his work has been published in high-impact journals and international conferences, and he is co-inventor on several patents. He has contributed to research projects on scalable graph neural network (GNN) training, memory-aware computing, distributed graph learning, social media data analysis, and is increasingly building expertise in quantum machine learning. He has delivered invited talks and tutorials on programming and development, natural language processing, distributed computing, machine learning with graphs, and quantum-enhanced algorithms. His research interests span graph neural networks, quantum machine learning, deep learning, big data analytics, multimodal learning, computer vision, natural language processing, crisis computing, information retrieval, distributed systems, operating-system design, and memory-system optimization.
