abstract: There  is  increasing  reliance on  the  intelligent  CCTV  systems  for  effective  analysis  and  interpretation  of  the  streaming  data  with  the  intentions  to  recognize  activities  and  to  ensure  public  safety.  Monitoring  videos  captured by surveillance cameras is always a difficult and time-consuming task. There is a need for automated analysis using computer vision methods in order to recognize/predict abnormal activities and assist authorities. Once, videos are processed using computer vision technologies; another problem is how this data is indexed for search, analysis, and real-time alerts since a large number of cameras continuously capture videos resulting vast  amounts  of  data.  In  order  to  address  this  issue,  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  generic  architecture  for  distributed intelligent surveillance and is composed of four layers. The first layer acquisition large number of the  video  streams  from  for  device  independent  video  stream  data  sources.  In  the  second  layer,  we  use  computer vision algorithms for semantic video annotation while exploiting the distributed in-memory computing engine. The third layer is used to persist the video stream and the to manage the intermediate results being produced by the second layer. Finally, the intermediate results are mapped to the RDF according to domain-specific application.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A four-layer distributed surveillance architecture that ingests large-scale CCTV streams, applies in-memory semantic video annotation, stores intermediate results, and maps them to RDF for efficient abnormal-activity detection and real-time alerts.
