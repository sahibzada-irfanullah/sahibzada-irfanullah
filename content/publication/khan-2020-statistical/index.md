abstract: Data obtained from the website and the source was ourworldindata.org.[1] Fourteen world regions and countries were selected for statistical analysis. The fourteen regions and the countries of the world were Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, china, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South East Asia, Western pacific and World. The source of the website has the data from 1980 to 2016 about the number of reported polio cases, the number of estimated polio cases and the number of polio cases per million population. In part one the number of estimated polio cases were generally higher than the number of reported polio cases. Statistical analysis like descriptive statistics. Minimum value, Maximum value, mean, standard deviation and variance was calculated. Paired sample t test was performed in the reported and estimated polio cases. In the second part Correlation among these regions were calculated and statistical inferences were formed. In the third part Regression equation linear, multiple and quadratic equation was formed in the three endemic countries Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study compares reported and estimated polio cases from 1980â€“2016 across fourteen regions using descriptive statistics, paired-sample t-tests, correlation analysis, and regression models to uncover discrepancies and regional trends.
