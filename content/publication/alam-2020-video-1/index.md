abstract: The proliferation of multimedia devices over the Internet of Things (IoT) generates an unprecedented amount of data. Consequently, the world has stepped into the era of big data. Recently, on the rise of distributed computing technologies, video big data analytics in the cloud has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. The current technology and market trends demand an efficient framework for video big data analytics. However, the current work is too limited to provide a complete survey of recent research work on video big data analytics in the cloud, including the management and analysis of a large amount of video data, the challenges, opportunities, and promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this study, which conducts a broad overview of the state-of-the-art literature on video big data analytics in the cloud. It also aims to bridge the gap among large-scale video analytics challenges, big data solutions, and cloud computing. In this study, we clarify the basic nomenclatures that govern the video analytics domain and the characteristics of video big data while establishing its relationship with cloud computing. We propose a service-oriented layered reference architecture for intelligent video big data analytics in the cloud. Then, a comprehensive and keen review has been conducted to examine cutting-edge research trends in video big data analytics. Finally, we identify and articulate several open research issues and challenges, which have been raised by the deployment of big data technologies in the cloud for video big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that presents the generalized view of the video big data analytics in the cloud. This paper provides the research studies and technologies advancing the video analyses in the era of big data and cloud computing.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study surveys the current landscape of cloud-based video big data analytics and proposes a service-oriented layered reference architecture to efficiently ingest, manage, and analyze massive video streams. It also identifies key challenges, opportunities, and future research directions for building scalable, intelligent video analytics platforms in the cloud.
