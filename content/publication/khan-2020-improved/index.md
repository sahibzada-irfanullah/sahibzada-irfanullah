abstract:  Sentiment  Analysis  (SA)  is  an  active  research  area  that  is  used  to  automatically  extract  useful  information  from  the  user-generated  content  (UGC)  to  classify  into  positive  and  negative  classes.  Recently, various machine-learning techniques, such as supervised machine learning, semi-supervised learning, and lexicon scoring for SA have been proposed. A high-quality training data is vital to learn a sentiment classifier for textual sentiment classification, but due to various domains, the labeled data for each  domain  is  scarce  or  unavailable.  The  manual  construction  of  labeled  corpora  is  a  time-consuming and laborious task because of the unstructured and unorganized nature of data. In order to address this issue, in this paper, we propose an improved co-training approach based on the n-gram and word2vec model for sentiment classification. Co-training is a semi-supervised learning approach that  has  effective  applications  in  textual  sentiment  classification.  The  empirical  evaluation  of  movie  review  datasets  shows  that  the  proposed  approach  outperforms  existing  techniques  in  terms  of  classification accuracy. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper introduces an improved co-training method combining n-gram features and Word2Vec representations to tackle scarce labeled data in sentiment analysis, demonstrating superior accuracy on movie review datasets.
